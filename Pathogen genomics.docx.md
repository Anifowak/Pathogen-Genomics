Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) such as **schistosomiasis**, **onchocerciasis**, **lymphatic filariasis**, and **trypanosomiasis** disproportionately affect Africa. Pathogen genomics has revolutionized our understanding of these diseases, enabling the identification of genetic variants responsible for drug resistance, transmission, and virulence, and helping develop diagnostic tools and treatments.

## **Key Contributions of Genomics in Africa**

### **Schistosomiasis** 
Genomic studies of *Schistosoma mansoni* have mapped drug resistance and identified potential vaccine targets.

### **Onchocerciasis**
 Whole-genome sequencing of *Onchocerca volvulus* has uncovered insights into ivermectin resistance, aiding in control strategies.

### **Lymphatic Filariasis**
 Genomic data of *Wuchereria bancrofti* has improved the understanding of its transmission patterns and population structure.

### **Trypanosomiasis (Sleeping Sickness)**
 Genomic studies on *Trypanosoma brucei* have revealed adaptive mechanisms that allow the parasite to evade the host immune response, informing drug and vaccine development.

---

## **Challenges:**

* **Limited infrastructure**: Many regions in Africa lack adequate genomic research facilities.

* **Genetic diversity**: The vast genetic variation in NTD pathogens complicates control and treatment.

* **Resistance**: Genomic surveillance is crucial to track emerging resistance to current drugs.

---

**Future Directions:**

* Investments in genomic infrastructure in Africa, collaborations, and the application of cutting-edge tools like CRISPR and next-generation sequencing can advance the fight against NTDs.
